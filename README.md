# FL_Speaking_Adventure
Simple Speaking Adventure Activity for Foreign Language Learners

The idea behind the game is:
Students follow a thief by collecting clues and following her to the next destination.
Students see pictures and get voice descriptions via TTS (text-to-speech), and then they must give voice commands via ASR (automatic speech recognition).

The default langauge is set to English, but the base code can be downloaded and modified to fit any foreign langauge teachers' needs.

This provides interactive speaking and listening that can be done solo or practiced in groups.
